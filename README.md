### CS555 - Foundations of Machine Learning with R Term Project
### Boston University

I examine whether or not there is a difference in the amount spent on wine by people grouped by level of education. If the global F test is significant, I also examine which of the pairwise group means are different. I also test whether the population means of the amount spent on wines across people grouped by education level is equal after controlling for income

## Data Set Overview
